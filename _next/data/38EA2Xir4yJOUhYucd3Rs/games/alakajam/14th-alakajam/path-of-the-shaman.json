I made a vow to get at least 100 — it took me many tries but I finally did it. Sadly, the game froze while in the midst of a run (see screen shot for high score). This happened to me three times — every so often it freezes during one of the \"trippy\" sessions after eating a magic mushroom. It happened in both Firefox and Chrome.\r\n\r\nAside from that, this game is a solid entry. The level of difficulty is just right and the audio and graphics are very good. I like especially the music — you folks nailed the audio category.

Honestly, the best part is getting the mushrooms with side effects. I really enjoyed having to navigate the map whenever the player get's confused or the controls are changed. I think it would be great if the animation time for the control change is shortened. After a while, it pulls you out of the experience whenever you have to sit and wait for the animation to end. Also, the game's a bit too easy? Maybe add more mushroom effects or at least increase the speed of the run as the player gets near in completing the items. Overall, this is a solid, complete game!","author":2332,"created":1646148622047,"updated":1646148622059},{"id":9245,"parent_id":null,"body":"Had some trouble playing this game unfortunatly as it looks like a lot of fun. The title screen loads and then I go to the game and have audio and it seems like the game is responding to the controls but the screen is black except for the HUD. This is on Safari, Chrome, and Brave on an M1 Mac.","author":48,"created":1646176496514,"updated":1646176496525},{"id":9260,"parent_id":null,"body":"This game was delightful! I kept replaying it just to get to the wackier visual action. The concept and execution was solid and had surprisingly great UX for a jam game (the visible keyboard switching to be specific). The music was super charming and I love how things changed up on the audio side too when picking up mushrooms. The difficulty was pretty high for me and as is typical with the genre of game, replayability is hurt a bit by having to start over from scratch and slowly working your way back to where you were, so maybe making it a bit more forgiving by having lives, health, or checkpoints would have helped.","author":498,"created":1646218024199,"updated":1646218024215},{"id":9270,"parent_id":null,"body":"I love the music in this game! The trippy visual effects when you take the mushrooms are nicely done and I like the art style as well as the feedback (sound and +x when you get a mushroom/crow).\r\nI also liked that the game gives you some time to \"prepare for controls\".\r\nHowever I think that 15 of each mushroom to finish the story mode is a bit much (I did not manage to get them), maybe something like 8 would be better.\r\nOn the other hand I enjoyed very much playing for score: you can choose to take only \"normal\" mushrooms and the game is relatively easy, but the score increases slowly. Or you can take risks and take \"special\" mushrooms that invert the controls and change the visuals to increase your score multiplier. My strategy was to take a lot of special mushrooms at the start, then when each normal mushroom gave me around 19 points I avoided every mushroom that had a side effect and only took normal mushrooms.\r\n\r\nAlso, I remember playing \"Zarguuf's Bone Crypt Adventure\" for the 11th Alakajam which I really liked despite not being able to finish it because it was too difficult for me. And it was nice to see the character come back in this game.","author":1739,"created":1646227479953,"updated":1646227479964},{"id":9282,"parent_id":null,"body":"That turned out to be a lot more fun than I would have thought it could be from the core dodge and pickup mechanic. The trippy visuals and control switching makes for surpisingly challenging gameplay. I think it is balanced pretty well too to make you want to keep trying for a better score. Didn't manage to make it to the end of Story Mode even, only max about  8 of each type, so maybe agree that Story mode should be a touch easier.\r\nArt style was cute and charming and I enjoyed the music too, just wish I could stop dying so I could hear more of it instead of just the begining part again and again. Also nice take on the theme it would have been a missed opportunity if no one had gone the trippy route. Fun was had.

I think so far having the controls switch for the first time was my favorite moment while playing games from the jam. Such a fun idea and as others have noted, the UI transition was executed flawlessly. I think it would have been cool if collecting more shrooms would f..k up your controls even more (like the left key being up etc). And the story mode was too long for me. Once yonu got the hang of the switching controls etc, there weren't enough new things to keep me interested.\r\nOther than that - awesome game!","author":1467,"created":1646319412859,"updated":1646319412875},{"id":9312,"parent_id":null,"body":"woow, love the visuals and sound design... just the overall bleepynes <3  A great interpretation of the Fungy-Theme.
