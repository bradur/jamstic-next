The visuals and audio are there, other aspects come a bit short.\r\n\r\nDefeating waves of enemies by moving about and lobbing projectiles is an old idea. Having a gate to protect and repair is a fine start, but should have been taken further. The tower could have its multiple floors targeted by different enemy types. If a floor is destroyed the player loses a benefit of some kind or the enemies receive a boost instead.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, having three floors increases the challenge on paper, but in practice movement is not needed as each enemy type can be attacked from the gate. If flying enemies could only be attacked from the top by making each projectile arc heavily (the upgrades ruin this at the moment) there would be an actual reason to climb up and down. Slower enemies, longer spell cooldowns and *one hit kill* projectiles would incentivize accuracy over spamming.\r\n\r\nIn short, utilizing the tower more would improve the latter ratings quite a lot. The technical qualities are good however.\r\n\r\nOverall: *Average (5.0)*  \r\nGraphics: *Good (7.0)*  \r\nAudio: *Good (7.0)*  \r\nGameplay: *Average (5.0)*  \r\nOriginality: *Bad (3.0)*  \r\nTheme: *Below Average (4.0)* ","author":138,"created":1569602411080,"updated":1569602513290},{"id":6454,"parent_id":null,"body":"Yay for tasty stew!\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the game. I felt that the balance was a bit off, with a pretty big difficulty spike in one of the middle levels, but otherwise just very easy. I found myself standing at the doorway shooting for 99% of the game which was a shame, but felt like a bit of a dominant strategy as I could hit all fliers before they got to the tower and hit the field of shield guys so they couldn't stop my magic missile spam. I think the game needs more reasons to move, because currently it can get a little mindless and you can ignore a lot of things.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the art and sounds, though it felt a little stranget that the audio just got louder as it hit more things which got a little out of hand at times.","author":601,"created":1569641207084,"updated":1569641207102}],"division":"team","coverColors":{"css":"--one: rgb(230,187,117);--two: rgb(233,233,233);--three: rgb(129,47,77);--four:
