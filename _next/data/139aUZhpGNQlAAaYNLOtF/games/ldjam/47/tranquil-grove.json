I rarely felt that I have wasted the \"expedition of the day\", usually returning with either a clear objective (having spotted an upgrade in the distance), or a clear idea of new paths to pursue the next time.\n\nSpeaking of the items, I felt that their placement and effect was effective as well, serving as direct goals and rewards for exploring a specific set of paths. Both the \"get rid of new kinds of obstacles\" and \"increase travel range\" bonuses felt meaningful, in the sense that they gave a feeling of actual progress and enabling of future explorations.\n\nThe skill-progression felt well balanced, with plenty of opportunities to improve either skill as needed. Although it took me some time to realize that you could actually dodge in combat (in effect, trading the more bountiful energy stat to save precious health). The steady amount of \"walking-XP\" at the same time meant that the time never felt completely wasted, even when ending up in a dead end.\n\n\nPresentation-wise, I really enjoyed the graphics, and the background tune was nice as well. The UI elements were clear and informative, with the only exception I notice being not being informed in all cases that boulders required a pickaxe to pass.\n\nGreat work! :-)","author":1576,"parent_id":0,"created":1601925275000,"updated":1601925356000},{"id":553822,"body":"Cool idea, and I like the fact that you make progress just by walking.

It was an exercise in frustration. It's like minit except with grinding. I can't even say it's badly made, it's probably balanced like this on purpose because of the theme. After the fifth loop it dawned on me how grindy it would be. \n\n=Scope=\nIf the game had been just a bit less grindy, the big map would have been a big plus. I assume you're supposed to grind in the lower-level areas some more so you can exhaust yourself faster instead of walking for miles and dying for few XP, so the big map is wasted on the loops.\n\n=Graphics=\nFor a game about exploration, it probably wouldn't have hurt to de-saturate the trees, make the grass a bit more varied, and have some transitions between the tiles, but I guess making a Wang tileset could easily have meant 20x as many tiles.\n\n=Audio=\nNice and relaxing ambiance.\n\nOverall, okay game, ambitious scope, very grindy.","author":8003,"parent_id":0,"created":1602089309000,"updated":1602090088000},{"id":582768,"body":"The constant ticking down with every movment had me feeling anxious at first, but after repeated rest and getting more of the world opened up, it became a bit more enjoyable.\nThe artwork looks pretty but maybe a more limited palette could help draw attention to key locations/items.\nSound and music are good.","author":11376,"parent_id":0,"created":1602099673000,"updated":1602099673000},{"id":586888,"body":"Nice camping simulator :)\n\nWaking up the next loop at the same location was frustrating at first...
