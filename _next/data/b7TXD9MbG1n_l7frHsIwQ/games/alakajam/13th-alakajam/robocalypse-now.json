Visibility was tough and I could never make out the difference between ally robots and enemies.\r\n\r\nThe concept of having this kind of Towerdefense setup with action gameplay is a really cool blend. The game would greatly benefit from some down time though. If you'd lean more into the TD angle and spawn enemies in waves and give the player a phase of looting/building inbetween combat phases it could become a lot more well rounded (granted though less frantic, which obviously has appeal aswell)","author":893,"created":1632554926960,"updated":1632554926970},{"id":8945,"parent_id":null,"body":"Very fun to play and quite atmospheric. I can only agree with Zach here - all I missed was a bit of downtime to cool off and boot some robots. I was just running in circles trying to shoot enemies and get some bots online, not really thinking about what I'm doing. Which can also be fun, but felt a bit stressful.","author":1023,"created":1632583683835,"updated":1632583683845},{"id":8952,"parent_id":null,"body":"Nice. The game had interesting mechanics, which could maybe be balanced a bit better (e.g. I felt the difficulty to be too gentle at first and then suddenly get impossible), but still provided a nice challenge. I tried multiple times but just always failed just shy of the 5k for the gun upgrade(?). The game is very dark, which is good for the scary atmosphere but bad when you get stuck on the somewhat low-contrast obstacles strewn about the map :) I felt my robots were a little bit useless, and especially when the enemy hordes are approaching trying to get one constructed is almost not even worth it. I think there were multiple cases where I was jumpstarting the top (3-part) robot and pressing space for the second time just â€¦ did nothing? Restarted the jumpstart attempt? I don't know if it was because I was pushed away or what. With games like these it is also super unforgiving to have hitscan (or even almost-hitscan) enemy bullets, because if at any point there is a critical mass of enemy robots that have line of vision, there is really nothing you can do to survive. I wonder if this could work as a \"bullet hell\" instead?","author":161,"created":1632650531682,"updated":1632650531698},{"id":8954,"parent_id":null,"body":"awesome game! at first i was a bit overwhelmed with the mass of robots coming at you and the flashing light but after i realized what i had to do i had a lot of fun. great visuals and music! one of the best entries i have seen so far.","author":1958,"created":1632653923025,"updated":1632653923037},{"id":8963,"parent_id":null,"body":"Thanks for the comments guys!\r\n<a href=\"https://alakajam.com/user/Aurel300\">@Aurel300</a> Sadly the restarting thing is actually a bug. The 3-part robot used to have a 1% red zone at the top, but we decided that it should never fail. I just removed the zone which left a 1% \"nothing\" there that restarts the process. You just probably managed to hit the top 1% multiple times :D","author":35,"created":1632687137590,"updated":1632687137602},{"id":9022,"parent_id":null,"body":"Wow, great entry all round! Graphics immediately impress with the high quality sprites and visual effects. Everything looks consistent and atmospheric. Music is fitting if maybe a little on the cheerful side.\r\n\r\nAs for gameplay, you nailed that as well, and that's coming from someone who does not like twin-stick shooters and is generally terrible at them. At the beginning, the spare parts around the base encourage you to venture out, and at this point you still have a chance to build some allies in relative peace. And you need some peace, what with the waiting time and power bar minigame. I love that there is an unlockable gun right there to entice you. The robots look varied in appearance, although I didn't really notice any difference in their behaviour.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I didn't get far enough to unlock the bad-ass gun, but I feel that this is entirely due to my lack of skill and not because of any unfairness in the game. (The fact that full screen gives me about 5 fps whereas the non-full screen is tiny and hard to control might also play a role.)","author":9,"created":1633255026333,"updated":1633255026344},{"id":9040,"parent_id":null,"body":"Felt very polished
