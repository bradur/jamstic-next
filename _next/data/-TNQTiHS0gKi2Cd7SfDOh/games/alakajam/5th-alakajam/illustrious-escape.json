From playing Talos, I realize level design is not easy with this sort of 3D puzzles. Removing the ability to walk was a bold idea that 100% paid off, both for pure gameplay and for making it easier to design levels. The only issue I had was that the instant teleportation could be disorienting at times: making the camera quickly slide to the target instead would have helped.\r\n\r\nGraphics and sound are also a great strength here, with the character model and animations in particular being top notch (nice finger snap :P). This all gives a good atmosphere, with my only wish being for the levels to look less repetitive. Dropping random models around, like skeletons or furniture would have been nice, but more importantly the similar texture between walls and floor make things feel a bit prototypey. Simply differenciating the textures & color better between the two would have helped a lot.\r\n\r\nStill excellent entry overall!","author":2,"created":1551086843826,"updated":1551086843826},{"id":5168,"parent_id":null,"body":"Nice puzzles, realy liked it","author":1110,"created":1551109512444,"updated":1551109512444},{"id":5295,"parent_id":null,"body":"Great little puzzle game!

I (we?) really appreciate it!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://alakajam.com/user/maartene\">@maartene</a>:\r\nI think there are three main reasons for our decision to leave out walking (apart from the obvious one: someone proposed it semi-jokingly and the others were like \"alright, let's do it!\")\r\n\r\n- Scope: I think the most important aspect in making a jam game is scoping properly. Removing the player's ability to walk around drastically reduced the features we needed to implement and the content we needed to create. We only had to care about the fixed points where the player can stand instead of every inch of every level.\r\n- Level design: We thought not allowing the player to walk around would let us to create interesting puzzles. All of the puzzles you see in the game are revolving around this idea of using the same resource (fire) to move around and burn down doors. So stripped down to very basics, the game is about managing your finite resources. I mean, it would be a totally different game with totally different puzzles if you could walk around. :) From the puzzle design point of view, it was both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, coming up with proper puzzles with such minimalistic mechanics was tricky. On the other hand, implementing the puzzles was very straightforward. So more drawing stuff on paper and less fooling around in the level editor.\r\n- Theme: Simply put, casting a spell to move fits the theme better than walking around.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think it's a cool gameplay mechanic that enables mouse-only controls. :)","author":327,"created":1551253285112,"updated":1551253285112},{"id":5433,"parent_id":null,"body":"@juutis thank you for your extensive explanation.

It's super polished and the puzzles are just great. Fire and teleport mechanics worked very nice togeter. The only one downside was the start: I was just clicking arround until the teleporting mechanic worked. The blue line sort of confused me a little because i through i could teleport anywere, maybe a fixed line on the torches instead of one that moved with the mouse would work better.","author":573,"created":1551317939440,"updated":1551317939440},{"id":5465,"parent_id":null,"body":"Enjoying this, though not completed it yet. I love the finger snap when restarting. To echo the other comments above it is easy to become disoriented, maybe more textures on the walls would have helped.

Amazing even, but VR titles have done first person teleportation to death due to necessity so one point reduced there.\r\n\r\nThematically strong. Spellcasting is used for everything yet it feels to me like something is missing. The enviroment isn't very magical and doesn't affect the spellcasting at all. Not that I can think of any suggestions at the moment... Hmm, I'll report back if anything comes up.\r\n\r\nThe puzzle mechanics are also great, but I'll drop one point due to bugs. A few times I could not retake a fire from a torch, and once the fire went through a wall. Both issues happened in the second to last level and forced a restart, *snap!*\r\n\r\nThe second to last level also took me the most time to solve as the last torch before the staircase is very hard to see. I'd suggest adding in a slight glow (or hud element) to each torch in view when holding a fireball. Looking for near invisible torches in the darkness isn't great user interface design when interactivity is about deductive logic, not pixel hunting or such.\r\n\r\nThe crosshair icon could change when targeting a door. I did accidentally burn a few doors when trying to light a torch instead.\r\n\r\nGreatness once again in the graphics department. Similarly to the themematic rating, the environment lacks little something something.. colorful? Tapestries on the walls, maybe?

The use of torches for both movement and opening doors is very clever: do more with less. The line-of-sight principle reminds me of The Talos Principle.

The teleport mechanic makes this particularly suitable for VR.\r\n\r\nThe puzzle design is pretty good, although it's possible to get stuck so that you have to reset. This is less than elegant, but understandable in such a short time frame.\r\n\r\nGraphics may not be flashy, but consistent and effective.
