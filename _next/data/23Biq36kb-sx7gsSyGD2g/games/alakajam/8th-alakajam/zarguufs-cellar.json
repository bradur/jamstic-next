Each floor darker than the last, filled with more menacing creatures…? Not here.\r\n\r\n**Note start!** You managed to put in quite a lot of systems and content for a jam. That's commendable, yet you are two people and, no, I don't give bonus points for effort, so here goes the usual. **Note end!**\r\n\r\nThe rooms keep getting bigger, but the challenge evaporates with fast boots and a *long range-multi-shot-no-sine-curve-nonsense* wand!

Growing in number doesn't help with the power creep. The apprentices get new wands, however those might be of the rubbish *shoot-at-walls* variety, rendering them too a push over. This inverted challenge curve truly is the major issue here, ruining not only the theme, but also the most-important of all: the nebulous and fantabulous *fun*.\r\n\r\nBored become those who are to repeat without change the samiest of similarities with no end in sight. I lost count of the floors, that is. Maybe add a reminder?\r\n\r\nI could produce other small nitpicks as well, yet that would hardly matter. Let's end on the positives this time. The music is a proper fantasy fare, and the few sound effects are spot on. As pointed out by others, many expected sound effects are missing though, a curse of setting the bar so high.
